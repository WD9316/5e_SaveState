Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\n**_Spells._** A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. _Plane shift_ and _gate_ can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. _Etherealness_ allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches\u2014such as the Elemental Planes. And the _astral projection_ spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\n**_Portals._** A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fogshrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations\u2014 circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns\u2014that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.

Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.\nWhen discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \u201cplaces\u201d at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day\u2014if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the **Upper Planes**. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the **Lower Planes**. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane\u2019s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn\u2019t match the plane\u2019s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable."", ""document__slug"": ""wotc-srd"", ""document__title"": ""5e Core Rules"", ""document__url"": ""http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"", ""name"": ""Outer Planes"", ""parent"": ""Beyond the Material"", ""slug"": ""outer-planes""}",,15c89c5dcd9df2e353cd8cfb25678b6328516df74bdb9371aa4163eb3d6c0fff,2025-11-24T04:46:46.719588Z
