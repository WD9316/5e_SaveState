When you use an action to present this scroll to an aberration whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the aberration, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust.

Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names. Only the feats of magic they achieved are of any worth to the broom.\n\n_**Sentience.**_ The broom is a sentient construct with Intelligence 19, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 17\\.

It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.\n\n**_Demands._** If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick).

Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a _short rest_ , learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.\n\n**Dancing Broom**\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle. When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your _attack roll_  and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or _invisible_  it has _advantage_  on its attack roll.\n\n While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you.

The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three spiky objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

A non-beast animal companion or familiar that is placed in the bag is treated as if it had been placed into a bag of holding and can be removed from the bag at any time. A beast animal companion or familiar disappears once placed in the bag, and the bag's magic is dormant until the week is up. At the end of the week, the animal companion or familiar exits the bag as a bramble creature (see the template in the sidebar) and can be returned to its original form only with a wish.

The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and Shadow Fey (see Tome of Beasts). The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an Overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options. Deities, Fey Lords and Ladies (see Tome of Beasts), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Plane of Shadow can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains.

Yet a fabled version of this tome is said to meander through literary circles\u2014a copy annotated by a mad genius.

While attuned to this book, you gain an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the usual requirements related to crafting a magic item aside from its cost.\n\nIn addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented around inventing, the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_, or keeping the book safely in your possession.\n\nOnce between _long rests_ , while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, choose one of the following:\n\n* Reduce research time by 75%.\n* Reduce component cost by 75%.\n* Reduce crafting time by 75%.\n* Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.\n* Reduce a crafting DC by 6.\n\nAfter three failures on the Intelligence check, th_e Crafter\u2019s Codex_ moves on. You retain a copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ but the magic and marginalia of the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it. Any bonuses accrued remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first). \n\n**Seekers of the Codex**\n\nThe _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ is coveted by collectors and ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the Crafter\u2019s Codex surely means encountering some of the following foes.\n\n__**Table: Seekers of the Codex**__\n| **1d6** | **Adversary**                                                         |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | Noble with entourage of bodyguards\u2014previous owner or antimagic zealot |\n| 2       | _Assassin_ , stealthy _mage_ , or _thief_                             |\n| 3       | Rival artificer (friendly or hostile)                                 |\n| 4       | Mischievous book-obsessed fey                                         |\n| 5       | Celestial or fiendish curator of an interplanar library               |\n| 6       | Rival artificer from an entirely different Material Plane             |\n\n**Destruction**\n\nThe secret knowledge that permeates the Crafter\u2019s Codex cannot simply be stricken from the world with ink, blade, or fire. When the artifact faces a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ is to eliminate every last copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ that exists in the multiverse\u2014if even one copy remains, even on another plane of existence, the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ persists."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Crafter\u2019s Codex"", ""rarity"": ""Artifact"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""crafters-codex-a5e"", ""type"": ""Wondrous Item""}",,183793b6a0958ed53818ad9b0acb8c98beb2c251c554784fc044b831ae8b5d34,2025-11-24T04:45:59.599281Z

Once worn by the monarch of an ancient crystal palace deep underground, the crown was lost after its wearer\u2019s grasping schemes brought calamity on their people. The power, ambition, and ruthless might of the Crystal Sovereign of Coranaal still lingers, granting the wearer the following properties:\n\n_**Crystal Skin.**_ Your skin takes on a jagged, shimmering appearance and feels firm and cold to the touch. You gain +2 to your Armor Class. Additionally, when you\u2019re hit by a ranged spell attack, roll 1d4\\. On a 3, you are unaffected and the spell is reflected back at its caster, rolling again to see if it hits.\n\n**_All-Seeing._** You gain truesight out to 30 feet. Additionally, you can use this trait to cast __clairvoyance_  at will, using the crown as your material component.\n\n**_Lord Under The Mountain._** Your Prestige Rating is increased by 2, or 4 if you\u2019re underground.\n\n**_Regal Bearing._** A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier you can, as an action, target one creature that can see you within 60 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom _saving throw_  (DC = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier) or use its next turn to fall _prone_  in supplication, taking no other actions. Additionally, when you\u2019re targeted with any attack by a creature within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make this saving throw as a reaction. On a failure it has _disadvantage_  on the attack and then falls prone as above.\n\n**_Greed of Coronaal._** It\u2019s said that, even as their palace crumbled, the Crystal Sovereign still coveted and guarded their treasures. You can use an action to summon an item from the hoard of Coronaal, an endlessly enormous extra dimensional space that you can access remotely. You instinctively know what\u2019s inside, and when you first access the hoard, roll on _Treasure_  for Challenge Ratings 23-30 to determine what\u2019s already there. This doesn\u2019t mean that you have any desire to share, however, and must make a DC 14 Wisdom _saving throw_  to willingly part, even temporarily, with any item that has been in the hoard.\n\nYou can also use an action to touch an item of up to Large size and send it to the hoard. However, the crown shuns items it deems unworthy, casting them into the Astral Plane if you attempt to store them. This includes magic items of common or uncommon rarity and any mundane items worth less than 500 gp. Additionally, as a security feature, creatures cannot enter this space; even the wearer can only access it remotely. Otherwise, the hoard has the limitations of any other interdimensional space in regards to Supply and dead creatures. Placing another interdimensional item, such as a _portable hole_ , in the hoard destroys the lesser item, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane. Additionally, 4 (2d4) random valuables from the horde are also lost in this way, though the crown of the crystal sovereign is otherwise unaffected.\n\n_**Curse.**_ When you attune to this crown, your _Destiny_  immediately changes to _Dominion_  if it\u2019s not already, and you can only fulfill it by reclaiming the Crystal Palace of Coronaal, which is lost to time and overtaken by creatures from the depths. You lose any existing Destiny features. In addition, if you have a chance to advance this Destiny (as determined by the Narrator) and do not take it, you lose all benefits from the crown and suffer a level of _strife_  each week until you pursue the opportunity, at which point you lose all strife gained this way and regain the benefits of the crown. These levels of strife cannot otherwise be removed.\n\nThe crown remains firmly affixed to your head and cannot be removed in any way, nor can your attunement be broken, unless you are beheaded, at which point you can never attune to the item again, even if you are brought back to life. The only other exception is if you reclaim the Crystal Palace and then choose to, in the presence of 4 sentient creatures, formally renounce your title while sitting on the throne of Coronaal, at which point the palace and crown begin to crumble, ending your attunement and destroying the item.\n\n**_Escalation._** When you fulfill this destiny, the save DC of Regal Bearing and the Armor Class bonus of Crystal Skin increase by 2, while the range of your truesight increases by 60 ft, your Prestige bonus is increased by 2, and you can cast __scrying_  at will using the crown as a focus."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Crown of the Crystal Sovereign"", ""rarity"": ""Artifact"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""crown-of-the-crystal-sovereign-a5e"", ""type"": ""Wondrous Item""}",,fa9253add63ef127753ff891925551d17b057c7baa9d1c75237b0915e2b79a23,2025-11-24T04:45:59.599281Z

You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n**_Star_**. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\n**_Sun_**. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\n**_Talons_**. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n\n**_Throne_**. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\n**_Vizier_**. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\n**_The Void_**. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. \n\n"", ""document__slug"": ""wotc-srd"", ""document__title"": ""5e Core Rules"", ""document__url"": ""http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"", ""name"": ""Deck of Many Things"", ""rarity"": ""legendary"", ""requires_attunement"": """", ""slug"": ""deck-of-many-things"", ""type"": ""Wondrous item""}",,185fa9b3e3d110734e1593490d381707f07970d4318121f82d7858832b673133,2025-11-24T04:45:59.599281Z

Most were created by gods of luck and are found in small and ornately carved coffers and have only 13 cards, but some have the full 22\\. The Narrator may decide, or roll 1d4 to determine randomly (a partial deck on a 1\u20133, or a full deck on a 4).\n\nBefore drawing, you must declare the number of cards that you intend to draw. A modified poker deck can be used to create your own physical deck using the substitutions below. A card's magic takes effect as soon as it is drawn. Once you begin drawing, each subsequent card must be drawn within an hour of the card that came before it. Failure to do so causes all of your remaining draws to fly out of the deck and take effect immediately. Once a card is drawn, if it is not a joker it is reshuffled into the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\nOnce you have drawn the number of cards that you\u2019ve declared, the deck resets and you may never draw from that deck again. Once all individuals present when the deck is discovered have drawn their cards, roll 1d4\\. On a 1\u20133 the deck vanishes, or on a 4 it returns to its coffer, allowing you to transport it should you so choose.\n\nThe Balance, Comet, Donjon, Fates, Fool, Gem, Idiot, Talons, and Vizier cards only appear in the 22 card deck.\n\n---\n\n\u2663 **Ace of Clubs: Talons.** Every magical item that you own is immediately destroyed. Artifacts are not destroyed and are instead cast into the multiverse.\n\n\u2663 **King of Clubs: Void.** Your soul is torn from your body and trapped in an object in a location of the Narrator\u2019s choosing where it is guarded by powerful beings. While your soul is trapped, your body is incapacitated. Even a _wish_ cannot restore your soul, but it can reveal its location. Any remaining draws from the deck are lost.\n\n\u2663 **Queen of Clubs: Flames.** You gain the enmity of a powerful devil. It seeks to destroy you along with all that you love or have built, inflicting as much misery upon you and your loved ones as possible before finally slaying you. This antagonism lasts until either you or the devil perish.\n\n\u2663 **Jack of Clubs: Skull.** A merciless harbinger of death appears and attempts to slay you. The harbinger appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet and immediately attacks. A sense of mortal dread fills any allies present, warning them to stay away. The harbinger fights until you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. It cannot be harmed by anyone other than you, and if anyone other than you attempts to harm it, another harbinger of death is summoned for them. Creatures slain by a harbinger cannot be restored to life by any means.\n\n\u2663 **Two of Clubs: Idiot.** Your Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 1d4+1, to a minimum of 1\\. You may draw one additional card beyond what you declared.\n\n\u2666 **Ace of Diamonds: Vizier.** At any point within a year of drawing this card, you may ask a question while meditating and immediately receive a truthful answer that helps you to solve a problem or dilemma as well as the wisdom and the knowledge to apply it.\n\n\u2666 **King of Diamonds: Sun.** You gain 50,000 XP, and a randomly determined wondrous item appears in your hands.\n\n\u2666 **Queen of Diamonds: Moon.** You are granted 1d3 wishes (as the __wish_ spell).\n\n\u2666 **Jack of Diamonds: Star.** Increase an ability score of your choice by 2\\. The score cannot exceed 24.\n\n\u2666 **Two of Diamonds: Comet.** Defeating the next hostile monster or group of monsters alone will grant you enough experience points to advance to the next level.\n\n\u2665 **Ace of Hearts: Fates.** You are granted the ability to reweave the fabric of reality, allowing you to circumvent or erase a single event as though it had never happened. You may use this ability immediately upon drawing the card or at any point prior to your death.\n\n\u2665 **King of Hearts: Throne.** You are granted proficiency in the Persuasion skill and gain a 1d6 expertise die on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks. You are also granted legal domain over a small keep or fortress on the plane that your character inhabits. Your new domain is overrun by monsters and must be liberated before it can be inhabited.\n\n\u2665 **Queen of Hearts: Key.** A magic weapon of at least rare rarity that you are proficient with appears in your hand. The weapon is chosen by the Narrator.\n\n\u2665 **Jack of Hearts: Knight.** A _veteran_  appears and offers you their service, believing it to be destiny, and will serve you loyalty unto death. You control this character.\n\n\u2665 **Two of Hearts: Gem.** You are showered in wealth. A total of 25 trinkets, easily portable pieces of art, or jewelry worth 2,000 gold each, or 50 gems worth 1,000 gold each appear directly in front of you. \n\n\u2660 **Ace of Spades: Donjon.** You vanish and are trapped in an extradimensional space. You are either unconscious in a sphere (50%) or trapped in a nightmare realm drawn from your own experiences and fears (50%). You remain in your prison until you are freed. While divination magics cannot locate you, a wish spell reveals the location of your prison. You cannot draw any more cards.\n\n\u2660 **King of Spades: Ruin.** All nonmagical wealth that you own is lost. Material items vanish. Property and other holdings are lost along with any documentation. You are destitute.\n\n\u2660 **Queen of Spades: Euryale.** You are _cursed_  by the card. You suffer a permanent \u20132 penalty to all _saving throws_ . Only a god or the Fates Card can end this curse.\n\n\u2660 **Jack of Spades: Rogue.** A trusted ally, friend, or other NPC (chosen by the Narrator) becomes a bitter enemy, although their identity is not revealed. They will act against you based upon their abilities and resources, and will try to utterly destroy you. Only a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC\u2019s hostility. \n\n\u2660 **Two of Spades: Balance.** Your history rewrites itself. You gain a randomly determined background, replacing your background feature with the new background feature. You do not change the skill proficiencies or ability score increases from your previous background, or gain new skill proficiencies or ability score increases.\n\n\ud83c\udccf **Joker with Trademark: Fool.** You lose 10,000 xp and must immediately draw again. If the experience lost in this manner would cause you to lose a level, you are instead reduced to the beginning of your current level instead.\n\n\ud83c\udccf **Joker without Trademark: Jester.** Fortune smiles on the foolish.

Long ago it was a desire to both bolster and renew their forces that led a mage to create a relic many would consider unthinkable: a scepter that twists the essence of life itself. With it the dead are remade into unrecognizable tangles of flesh that despite their deformity do the wielder of the scepter\u2019s bidding, all as their allies are healed and empowered with vigor far beyond mortal bounds.\n\nThis heavy silver scepter has two heads, both cast in metal and staring out of glassy onyx eyes. One head is a skull, its jaw thrown open and its teeth unnaturally elongated. At the other end of the scepter is a cherubic human face that is turned upwards as though determined not to look at its sibling. \n\nNo one is certain whether it was the creator\u2019s shame that led them to hide the scepter, or if their enemies cast it out of memory for fear of its power. What is known is that the legend of the _Dread Caduceus_ has endured and that whispers of its whereabouts have not been silenced by time.\n\nWhile you are attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_ you may use either end of the scepter to activate its powers.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Dread Caduceus_, a holy scepter with the power to raise the dead. \n\n**DC 18** The cherub and skull heads cause healing and necromantic effects, respectively.\n\n**DC 21** Those who use the scepter risk having their very flesh corrupted and their souls devoured.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ warps your life energy, twisting your flesh as it corrupts that of others. While you are attuned to the scepter, your organs shift and twist, sticking to one another within you. Take 1d6 necrotic damage each dawn from this effect. This damage can only be healed by a _long or short rest_ . You also have _disadvantage_  on initiative rolls as you are distracted by this tangible shifting within.\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has 2d10 charges and regains 1d10 charges each dawn. When you reduce the _Dread Caduceus_ to 0 charges, you take 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you instantly die and cannot be resurrected (even by a _wish_  spell).\n\n**Cherub**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the cherub head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 30 feet: \n\n_**Heal.**_ The creature regains 1d8+1 hit points for each expended charge. \n\n**_Healing Nimbus (3 Charges)_**. A nimbus of healing appears around the creature for 1d6 rounds. For the duration, whenever the creature takes damage from an attack it regains 1 hit point, and when an attack misses the creature it regains 1d4 hit points.\n\n_**Invulnerability (3 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to damage from nonmagical attacks for 1d4 rounds.\n\n_**Exhaustless (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to _fatigue_  for 1d6 days.\n\n_**Resistance (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes resistant to one type of damage of your choice for 1d6 rounds. This property has no effect if the creature already has resistance to that damage type.\n\n**_Cure (10 Charges)_**. The creature is healed of any _curses_ , _diseases_ , _poisons_ , or other negative effects, even if a _wish_  spell has previously been unsuccessful.\n\n_**Invigorate (10 Charges).**_ The creature permanently increases its maximum hit points by 1d8+1\\. A creature can only benefit from this property once. \n\n**Skull**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the skull head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 100 feet: \n\n_**Animate Skeleton (1 Charge).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating the skeleton of its body to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _skeleton template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_. \n\n_**Animate Zombie (2 Charges).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating it as a zombie to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _zombie template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus._\n\n_**Empower Undead (2 Charges).**_ Choose 1d6 undead that you can see within range. Whenever one of the chosen undead makes a weapon attack it deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. Even on a miss, the undead deals 1d4 necrotic damage.\n\n**_Animate Legion (6 Charges)._** You return 3d10 dead humanoids to a semblance of life, transforming their corpses into _zombies_ . \n\nYou can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead you create using the _Dread Caduceus._ When you command multiple undead, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete. \n\nIn addition, any creature you animate in this fashion retains injuries or disfigurements that were upon its corpse, and it continues to decompose."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Dread Caduceus"", ""rarity"": ""Artifact"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""dread-caduceus-a5e"", ""type"": ""Wondrous Item""}",,a11a37784c82de7c96c9b81d1efb1b00ffa734321df906d7f8ef2c81447c2002,2025-11-24T04:46:00.211934Z

You can use an action to seize and stow the eye, returning it to an inert and inactive state. \n\nWhile the eye is actively orbiting your head, your Intelligence score increases by 2 (to a maximum of 22), you gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks and Perception checks, and you cannot be _surprised_  or _blinded_ . \n\n_**Innate Arcane Eye.**_ While the eye orbits your head, you know and can innately cast _arcane eye_ without expending a spell slot or the need for material components.\n\n_**Shared Paranoia.**_ After you have attuned to the eye and it has been and active for 24 hours, you develop a paranoia that persists as long as it remains active. While paranoid you have _disadvantage_  on Insight checks and you are considered roughing it if you sleep in the same room or tent as another humanoid creature. \n\n_**Sentience.**_ The eye is a sentient construct with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 8\\.

It is constantly paranoid and convinced that some worse fate could befall it at any moment. Once attuned it will try to learn everything and anything you know, especially secrets. If you are forthcoming with information the eye grows to trust you, but can be brought into conflict if you withhold any information. When in conflict the eye shuts and you no longer gain any of the eye\u2019s benefits or properties except for Shared Paranoia. The eye only opens again if you divulge an important secret or the information initially withheld. \n\n_**Destroying the Eye.**_ The eye is unbreakable but it has the power to implode and disintegrate itself. Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces the eye that some horrifying and frightening threat is inevitably soon to befall it.

A beautifully forged band of platinum encircles the gem and affixes it to a well-made series of interlocking platinum chain links. The violet gem is warm to the touch. While wearing this amulet, you can't be frightened and you don't suffer from exhaustion. In addition, you always know which item within 20 feet of you is the most valuable, though you don't know its actual value or if it is magical. Each time you finish a long rest while attuned to this amulet, roll a 1d10. On a 1-3, you awaken from your rest with that many valuable objects in your hand. The objects are minor, such as copper coins, at first and progressively get more valuable, such as gold coins, ivory statuettes, or gemstones, each time they appear. Each object is always small enough to fit in a single hand and is never worth more than 1,000 gp. The GM determines the type and value of each object. Once the left eye of an ornate and magical statue of a pit fiend revered by a small cult of Mammon, this exquisite purple gem was pried from the idol by an adventurer named Slick Finnigan. Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol.

While mounted on a ship, the figurehead\u2019s magic affects the ship and every creature on the ship. A figurehead can be mounted on any ship larger than a rowboat, regardless if that ship sails the sea, the sky, rivers and lakes, or the sands of the desert. A ship can have only one figurehead mounted on it at a time. Most figureheads are always active, but some have properties that must be activated. To activate a figurehead\u2019s special property, a creature must be at the helm of the ship, referred to below as the \u201cpilot,\u201d and must use an action to speak the figurehead\u2019s command word. \nAlbatross (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship\u2019s pilot can double its proficiency bonus with navigator\u2019s tools when navigating the ship. In addition, the ship\u2019s pilot doesn\u2019t have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when peering through fog, rain, dust storms, or other natural phenomena that would ordinarily lightly obscure the pilot\u2019s vision. \nBasilisk (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship\u2019s AC increases by 2. \nDragon Turtle (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to fire damage, and the ship\u2019s damage threshold increases by 5. If the ship doesn\u2019t normally have a damage threshold, it gains a damage threshold of 5. \nKraken (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can animate all of the ship\u2019s ropes. If a creature on the ship uses an animated rope while taking the grapple action, the creature has advantage on the check. Alternatively, the pilot can command the ropes to move as if being moved by a crew, allowing a ship to dock or a sailing ship to sail without a crew. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action. When the ship\u2019s ropes have been animated for a total of 10 minutes, the figurehead\u2019s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nManta Ray (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship\u2019s speed increases by half. For example, a ship with a speed of 4 miles per hour would have a speed of 6 miles per hour while this figurehead was mounted on it. \nNarwhal (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to cold damage, and the ship can break through ice sheets without taking damage or needing to make a check. \nOctopus (Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on ships designed for water travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to dive beneath the water. The ship moves at its normal speed while underwater, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour underwater, the figurehead\u2019s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nSphinx (Legendary). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship that isn\u2019t designed for air travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can command the ship to rise into the air. The ship moves at its normal speed while in the air, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to descend at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches land or water. When the ship has spent a total of 8 hours in the sky, the figurehead\u2019s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nXorn (Very Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship designed for land travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to burrow into the earth. The ship moves at its normal speed while burrowing, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. The ship can burrow through nonmagical, unworked sand, mud, earth, and stone, and it doesn\u2019t disturb the material it moves through. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship.

It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish.

This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common.

It has the following additional properties. \n\n_**Red Reaping.**_ Whenever you use _Harvest_ to reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs that creature\u2019s soul and stores it within. _Harvest_ cannot store more than one soul in this way and the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit points while a creature\u2019s soul is already contained within it are not affected by this property.\n\n_**Sow the Reaped.**_ You can use an action to strike the ground with the sickle and produce a blood clone using a creature\u2019s soul stored within _Harvest._ This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones formed in this way act immediately after you in initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to the best of their ability. Without such commands, the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed, a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10 minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever afterlife was intended for it.\n\n_**Only Life May Die.** Harvest_ has no effect on unliving creatures, and passes harmlessly through constructs and undead when it is used to attack them. \n\n_**Sentience.** Harvest_ is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17\\. It sees and hears using your senses. _Harvest_ communicates with only you telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is not attuned to.\n\n_**Personality.**_ This sickle originally had a much more benign purpose, created by a halfling archdruid to bring forth a new plant for each one harvested. When its creator was killed by an orcish warchief it became a weapon, and in her hands it grew to find a new purpose. It eventually convinced its bearer to sow what she reaped, and caused the very spirit and blood of those she had cut down to slaughter its orcish captors. _Harvest_ has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. _Harvest_ tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its \u201cculling\u201d. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth\u2019s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using Harvest to slay a sentient creature, you\u2019ll be in conflict with _Harvest_. When in conflict, any time you use the Sow the Reaped property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into _Harvest_. \n\n_**Destroying Harvest.**_ _Harvest_ is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering _Harvest_ an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Harvest"", ""rarity"": ""Legendary"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""harvest-a5e"", ""type"": ""Weapon""}",,b7f3a74b1958cc3fb22527564373827aeb7e143e9e4a9d74c8d88634b30ced31,2025-11-24T04:46:01.411952Z

To store a spell in the stone, a creature must cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell while holding it. The spell is drawn into the stone with no other effect.

Either way it is this weapon and this weapon only that can kill the golden rooster V\u00ed\u00f0\u00f3pnir (which sits in the branches of Yggdrasil and may be tied to Ragnar\u00f6k, or possibly be another name for Gullinkambi) so that its wing joints (the only things that will suffice) can be used to distract the dogs guarding the flame-encircled castle holding Mengl\u00f6\u00f0, a maiden fated to be married to the hero Svipdagr. The runed weapon awaits within however, protected by the j\u00f6tunn Sinmara (a _storm giant_ ) who will only exchange it for a tail feather from the golden rooster\u2014that can only be harmed by the very same sword, creating a paradoxical task.

Along the top there is a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 23 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch revealing a cylinder wide enough for a Medium creature to crawl inside. The _Nautilus_ is a Gargantuan object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 25  \n**Hit Points:** 400 (damage threshold 20)  \n**Speed** swim 200 ft.

While the hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.\n\nThe steel submarine holds enough air for 15,000 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside (at most 625 for 24 hours).

Interior doors are airtight, have AC 20 and 50 hit points, and can be bypassed with DC 18 Dexterity (thieves\u2019 tools) checks or DC 25 Strength checks.\n\nThe _Nautilus_ floats on water.

Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature at the helm can use an action to pilot the _Nautilus_ by making a DC 18 Intelligence (vehicle \\[water\\]) check, with disadvantage if there are no other creatures controlling the ballasts, hydraulics, and sensors (each an action), or with _advantage_  if each position has a creature helping. On a success, the pilot can double the effects of any acceleration, deceleration, or turning they make with the _Nautilus_ on their turn. In addition, the pilot can send the submarine careening into a creature or object, making an attack roll as usual.\n\n_**Prow.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 34 (8d6+6) piercing damage.

It's a sturdy wooden stave, 6 to 10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored target of the pole's curse.

Typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late. The pole is created to punish a specific person for a specific crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as \u201cthe person who blinded Lars Gustafson\u201d isn't precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 333 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. If the saving throw is successful, the pole recasts the spell at the end of each round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down the pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once.

When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five _Orbs of Dragonkind_ (or _Dragon Orbs_) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts _suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\n\n**_Random Properties_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ has the following random properties:\n\n* 2 minor beneficial properties\n* 1 minor detrimental property\n* 1 major detrimental property\n\n**_Spells_**. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: _cure wounds_ (5th-level version, 3 charges), _daylight_ (1 charge), _death ward_ (2 charges), or _scrying_ (3 charges).\n\nYou can also use an action to cast the _detect magic_ spell from the orb without using any charges.\n\n**_Call Dragons_**. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n\n**_Destroying an Orb_**.

A creature remains attuned to the mirror as long as it is on the same plane of existence as the mirror or until it chooses to end its attunement to the mirror during a short rest. Phase mirrors look almost identical to standard mirrors, but their surfaces are slightly clouded. These mirrors are found in a variety of sizes, from handheld to massive disks. The larger the mirror, the more power it can take in, and consequently, the more creatures it can affect. When it is created, a mirror is connected to a specific plane. The mirror draws in starlight and uses that energy to move between its current plane and its connected plane. While holding or touching a fully charged mirror, an attuned creature can use an action to speak the command word and activate the mirror. When activated, the mirror transports all creatures attuned to it to the mirror's connected plane or back to the Material Plane at a destination of the activating creature's choice. This effect works like the plane shift spell, except it transports only attuned creatures, regardless of their distance from each other, and the destination must be on the Material Plane or the mirror's connected plane. If the mirror is broken, its magic ends, and each attuned creature is trapped in whatever plane it occupies when the mirror breaks. Once activated, the mirror stays active for 24 hours and any attuned creature can use an action to transport all attuned creatures back and forth between the two planes. After these 24 hours have passed, the power drains from the mirror, and it can't be activated again until it is recharged.

Whether summoned or drawn by hunger, the mind-bending entity crosses black seas of infinity to gorge upon mortal civilizations and gods alike.\n\nRarely in the uncounted eons of his existence, the spore of the Devouring King is denied. In this reality primordial powers drove him back before he took root, destroying him almost completely. Of his titanic form only a piece of skull, a fragment of wing membrane, and a piece of its strange heart survived. Nyth'zerogg's might was such that even these pieces contain terrible power, housing a fragment of his essence and a shard of his alien psyche.\n\nSince Nyth\u2019Zerogg\u2019s destruction pieces of the raiment have shown up throughout history, ultimately destroying their bearers and causing untold devastation. The destruction that they have wrought is insignificant compared to the danger that they pose however, as these artifacts hold the key to restoring the spore of Nyth\u2019Zerogg so that he may consume all reality. The _Raiment of the Devouring King_ consists of three pieces: a cloak, a crown, and an orb. To attune to a piece, you must awaken it by pouring the blood of a recently sacrificed sapient creature onto it, allowing you to graft it to your body in a process that takes a minute, during which you are _incapacitated_  by agony. Once attuned, pieces can only be removed if you are killed.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is part of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ the remains of an ancient being who consumed worlds. \n\n**DC 18** There are three surviving pieces of the raiment: a cloak, a crown, and an orb.\n\n**DC 21** The cloak grants flight and teleportation, the crown transforms the wearer\u2019s body, and the orb enhances their mind.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nWhile you are attuned to any piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ you are subject to Malignant Influence (see below) and gain the following benefits:\n\n* You cease aging and become immune to poison and disease.\n* You gain a pool of 8 charges that can be spent to fuel the _Raiment of the Devouring King\u2019s_ magical properties (save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). You regain 1d4+1 charges each dusk.\n\n**A Complete Set**\n\nBecause of their powerful desire to be together, no matter how many pieces of the Raiment of the Devouring King you wear they count as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement. For each additional piece of the Raiment of the Devouring King that you acquire, you gain the following benefits:\n\n**_Two Pieces._** Your pool of charges increases to 12\\. You can use an action to regain 1 expended charge by messily devouring an _incapacitated_  or _unconscious_  creature within your reach, killing it in the process. Creatures slain in this manner can only be returned to life by means of a _wish_ or __true resurrection ._\n\n_**Three Pieces.**_ Your pool of charges increases to 16\\. When you take a _short rest_ , you can extend tendrils into the ground and regain 1d4+1 charges by consuming natural energy within a 1-mile radius. All plant life in the area dies and beasts become _poisoned_  while in the area. This property can only be used in an area once per decade, after which it cannot support life for the next 10 years.\n\nYou cannot be permanently killed unless each piece of the raiment is cut from your body in conjunction with a carefully worded __wish_ spell. Instead, you return to life 1d3 days later.\n\n**Cloak of the Devouring King**\n\nThis deep jade cloak resembles a large piece of torn wing membrane. When attuned, it grafts to your back, reweaving muscle and bone and turning into a single leathery wing that grants a portion of Nyth\u2019zerogg\u2019s vitality.\n\n While attuned to the _Cloak of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Constitution score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if your Constitution is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a fly speed equal to your Speed.\n* You regain 1d8 hit points at the beginning of each of your turns if you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, you regrow the missing part within 1d6 days.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: _longstrider_ (1 charge), __misty step_  (2 charges), __blink_ (3 charges), _dimension door_  (4 charges), __plane shift_  (5 charges), or _teleport_ (5 charges)\n\n**Crown of the Devouring King**\n\nThe alabaster crown resembles a jagged piece of flat bone affixed to a crude iron band. When worn, it settles so that a single spoke of bone extends above the wearer's eye. When you attune to the skull, it grafts with your bone and grants a portion of Nyth\u2019zerogg\u2019s strength.\n\nWhile attuned to the _Crown of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Strength score is increased to 20\\.

This armor does not impose _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You can use an action to spend 1 charge to shape chitin and bone from your body into a +1 weapon. You may only have two such weapons in existence at a time. Any ammunition needed is created as the weapon is fired. You may spend 1 charge as part of an action to deliver touch spells through a weapon created in this manner by making a single weapon attack as a part of that action. A weapon created in this manner crumbles to dust a round after it leaves your person.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __shield_  (1 charge), __enlarge/reduce_  (2 charges), __protection from energy_ (self only; 2 charges), _stoneskin_ (self only; 3 charges).\n\n**Orb of the Devouring King**\n\nThis crimson orb resembles a massive, calcified heart suspended on a crude chain. When the orb returns to life, hooked tendrils extend and burrow into your chest, lodging it there where it grants a portion of the god\u2019s mind and knowledge.\n\n While attuned to the _Orb of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Choose Intelligence or Charisma. The chosen ability score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if the chosen ability score is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a 1d10 expertise die on Intelligence checks.\n* When you take a short rest, you can recover an expended spell slot of 6th-level or higher by spending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot recovered.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __detect thoughts_ (1 charge)_, suggestion_ (2 charges), __black tentacles_ (3 charges), _telekinesis_  (4 charges), _dominate monster_  (5 charges).\n\n**Malignant Influence**\n\nEach piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ longs to be united with the others so that Nyth\u2019Zerogg may live again. While attuned to a piece of the artifact, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom _saving throw_  once per month or gain a level of Malignant Influence, which cannot be removed while you are attuned to the _Raiment of the Devouring King._ With two pieces of the artifact attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per week, and when all three pieces of the artifact are attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per day.\n\n_**Level 1**._ You become obsessed with acquiring the other pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ and devote all of the time and resources at your disposal to the task.\n\n_**Level 2.**_ You become ravenous and must consume one living sapient being each day or gain a level of _fatigue_  that persists until you consume such a creature.\n\n_**Level 3.**_ You fall entirely under the sway of the Raiment of the Devouring King. You gain the Chaotic and Evil alignment traits, and you will stop at nothing to see Nyth\u2019Zerogg reborn. You immediately become an NPC under the Narrator\u2019s control.\n\n**Awakening Nyth\u2019Zerogg**\n\nIf all three pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ graft to a single host and they acquire three levels of Malignant Influence, the host\u2019s mind and soul are devoured as fuel for Nyth\u2019zerogg\u2019s reawakening. The exact consequences of such a reawakening are left to the Narrator but likely pose an extinction level threat to mortals and gods alike.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nMany attempts have been made to destroy pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ yet they always reform. Some believe that they can only be destroyed by plunging a creature with all three pieces of the artifact grafted to its body into the heart of a star or a true flame in the center of the Elemental Plane of Fire\u2014though even this is just a theory."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Raiment of the Devouring King"", ""rarity"": ""Artifact"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""raiment-of-the-devouring-king-a5e"", ""type"": ""Wondrous Item""}",,1b009fa654dd5df53fac28ebaf3ed4ad54fb23346ab631cafa33dd6244fa7ddf,2025-11-24T04:46:03.641773Z

Justicars are arbiters of law and order, operating independently of any official city guard or watch divisions. They are recognizable by their black, hooded robes, silver masks, and the rods they carry as weapons. These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title. The Magister has made it their duty to oversee order in the city and executes their plans through the Justicars, giving them the Magister's mark, a signet ring, as a symbol of their authority. While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings.

With all manner of wheels, gears, cables, and hinges, when worn its movements are surprisingly fluid, if somewhat loud and heavy.\n\nThe last of its kind, the _Serveros War Engine_ was used by a forgotten empire's soldiers in wars that spread far beyond their kingdom. It\u2019s hard to imagine there may once have been entire armies outfitted with these magical constructs and engaged in battle against one another, and impossible to conceive of the untold destruction they wrought.\n\nMounting the war engine is a fairly straightforward matter. As you enter the construct, you can don a helm and belt, both connected to the war engine, which allow you to attune to and control the construct. The construct is not sentient and moves only when controlled in this way.\n\nWhen controlling the construct, you form a psychic bond with it, seeing through its eyes, moving with its limbs, and experiencing pain through its body.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Serveros War Engine_, the last war machine of a forgotten empire. \n\n**DC 18** The engine is piloted from inside, and only those with mental and physical fortitude can endure it. In addition to offering great might, it can manifest arcane blades, cannons, and other effects.\n\n**DC 21** Destroying the engine requires destroying the helm, which is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Serveros War Engine_ has one lesser artifact benefit. Piloting the war engine can be quite taxing, both mentally and physically. You gain no benefits from a _long or short rest_  while mounted in the war engine, and when you expend its last available charge you suffer both a level of _fatigue_  and _strife_ .\n\nWhile you are attuned to, mounted inside, and controlling the _Serveros War Engine_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your AC becomes 18.\n* Your Strength score becomes 21.\n* You are Huge-sized.\n* Your Speed becomes 40 feet.\n* You have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  made to avoid being _grappled_  or knocked _prone_ .\n* You sustain only 1 hit point of damage for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt to you.\n* Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage.\n* Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.\n* You have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You are vulnerable to psychic damage.\n\n**Charged Properties**\n\nThe war engine also has several built-in features, some of which are powered by stored electrical charges or drain energy from your life force.\n\n* A massive sword hilt is secured to the construct\u2019s hip by an incredible magnetic force. You can use a bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to draw the hilt and engage its plasma blade.\n\n_**Plasma Blade**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two hands.\n\n* An arcane cannon is housed in the construct\u2019s left forearm. You can use an action or bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the arcane cannon.\n\n_**Arcane Cannon**_. _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 120/300 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (2d6) radiant damage.\n\n* The construct\u2019s right hand is detachable. You can use an action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the gauntlet as a projectile.\n\n_**Gauntlet Grapple.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 60/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6+5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is _grappled_ . You can use a bonus action to retract the hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target moves with the hand.\n\n The _Serveros War Engine_ begins with 1d20 charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check, 2d10 charges can be restored during a _long rest_ .\n\n**Warframe Variations**\n\nThe Narrator may apply one or more of the following variant options if desired.\n\n_**Airborne.**_ You can expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to unfold magical wings and gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute.\n\n_**Disrepair.**_ When first discovered, the _Serveros War Engine_ may be completely depleted of stored charges and heavily damaged, or perhaps almost completely dismantled. With maintenance, care, and careful reconstruction using Engineering (or a wish spell), it can be restored to its full, terrible power.\n\n_**Glass Jaw.**_ When the _Serveros War Engine_ takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, roll a d20\\. On a 1, the war engine\u2019s head is knocked off, disabling the artifact until it is repaired with a DC 23 Intelligence (Engineering) check and 8 hours of work.\n\n_**Mortal Echoes.**_ The _Serveros War Engine\u2019s_ last pilot died while mounted within the war engine, and echoes of their psyche still linger within the construct. When first attempting to attune to the artifact, you relive the final moments of the dead pilot and make a DC 18 Charisma _saving throw_ . On a failure, you take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and gain a short-term _mental stress effect_ .\n\n**_Nautical._** You gain a swim speed of 40 feet. In addition, you can use an action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to seal the cockpit and fill it with breathable air which lasts for 1 hour.\n\n_**Recon.**_ You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet and can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to activate magical floating discs on the soles of the construct\u2019s feet. The discs last for 1 hour during which time the construct does not cause you to have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and you leave no tracks on the ground.\n\n_**Serveros Slayer.**_ In lieu of the arcane cannon and detachable fist, the construct is equipped with a psyblade in each hand. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to deploy one or both psyblades. \n\n_**Psyblade.** Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) psychic damage.\n\n_**Specialized Weaponry**_. Instead of a giant plasma sword, the _Serveros War Engine_ has one of the following weapons. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to equip and activate the weapon.\n\n_**Discus Throwing Shield**. Melee_ or _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ reach 5 ft. or range 40/80 ft., one target, or if thrown two targets within 10 feet of each other. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage. In addition, while the shield is donned your AC increases by 2.\n\n_**Extendable Metal Staff**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning, or 18 (3d8+5) bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands, and a Large or smaller target makes a DC 18 Strength _saving throw_  or is knocked _prone_ .\n\n_**Shocking Net.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 30/60 ft., all targets in a 15-foot square area. _Hit:_ 9 (2d8) lightning damage and the target is _grappled_ . At the start of your turn, conscious creatures grappled by the net take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. This weapon cannot damage a creature with 0 hit points.\n\n_**Sonic War Hammer.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (3d8+5) thunder damage, or 21 (3d10+5) thunder damage when wielded with two hands.\n\n**Destroying the War Engine**\n\nOf all its various parts and components the key to disabling and ultimately destroying the war engine is the helm. The rest of the massive construct might feasibly be replaced or reengineered by an ingenious mind. However with its complex structure, both magical and mechanical, replicating the controller headpiece requires arcane knowledge and technical documentation that disappeared with the war engine\u2019s creators long ago. \n\nThe helm is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm. Bypassing its magical protections requires two steps: first, a __dispel magic_ cast at 5th-level or higher is needed to make the invisible barrier around the war engine\u2019s helm vulnerable for 6 seconds, followed by a __disintegrate_ spell cast at 7th-level or higher to completely dissolve the barrier. Once the barrier is dissolved, for the next 24 hours the helm can be destroyed like any other item (AC 22, 100 hit points) before its magical protections regenerate and fully repair it."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Serveros War Engine"", ""rarity"": ""Artifact"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""serveros-war-engine-a5e"", ""type"": ""Wondrous Item""}",,a1dd30406eff5c90b2edac4c04d6018429a1d0e8b4378f5d5f1d8a64e66906b5,2025-11-24T04:46:04.768261Z
items:servile-shabti,items,servile-shabti,Servile Shabti,https://api.open5e.com/v1/magicitems/servile-shabti/,vom,Vault of Magic,"{""desc"": ""Crafted to serve in place of the dead in the afterlife, shabti are often used by the living for their own ends. These 1-foot-tall statuettes are crafted of ceramic, stone, or terracotta and are garbed in gear indicative of their function. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the shabti to a point on the ground within 30 feet of you, it grows into a Medium construct that performs the tasks for which it was created. If the space where the shabti would grow is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u2019t enough space for the shabti, the shabti doesn\u2019t grow. Unless stated otherwise in an individual shabti\u2019s description, a servile shabti uses the statistics of animated armor, except the servile shabti\u2019s Armor Class is 13, and it doesn\u2019t have the Multiattack or Slam actions. When the shabti is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a ceramic, stone, or terracotta statue, rather than a suit of armor. The shabti is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts immediately after you. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you unless specified in the shabti\u2019s description). If you issue no commands, the shabti takes the Dodge action and no other actions. The shabti exists for a duration specific to each shabti. At the end of the duration, it reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti\u2019s description. Crafter Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti wears a leather apron and carries the tools of its trade. Each crafting shabti is skilled in a single craft\u2014 weaponsmithing, pottery, carpentry, or another trade\u2014and has proficiency with the appropriate artisan\u2019s tools. You can use an action to command the shabti to craft a single, nonmagical item within its skill set, so long as you provide it the raw materials to do so. The shabti works at incredible speeds, needing only 10 minutes per 100 gp value of the item to finish its task. A crafting shabti can never create magic items. Once it completes its task, the shabti reverts to statuette form, and it can\u2019t be used again until a number of hours have passed equal to twice the market value in gold pieces of the item crafted (minimum of 10 hours). Defender Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. You can use a bonus action to command the shabti to either defend you or harass an enemy you can see within 30 feet of you. If the shabti defends you, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has disadvantage on melee weapon attack rolls against you. If the shabti harasses a creature, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls against that creature. The shabti remains active for up to 8 hours, after which it reverts to statuette form and can\u2019t be used again until 3 days have passed. Digger Shabti (Uncommon). The shabti carries a shovel and pick. You can command the shabti to excavate earthworks to your specifications. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of earth or mud in any fashion (digging a hole or trench, raising a rampart, or similar), which takes 1 minute to complete. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of stone in a similar fashion, but it takes 10 minutes to complete. The shabti can work for up to 1 hour before reverting to statuette form. Once used, the shabti can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed. Farmer Shabti (Rare). This shabti carries farming implements. If you activate it in an area with sufficient soil and a climate suitable for growing crops, the shabti begins tilling the earth and planting seeds it carries, which are magically replenished during its time in statuette form. The shabti tends its field, magically bringing the crops to full growth and harvesting them in a period of 8 hours. The yield from the harvest is enough to feed up to twelve creatures for 7 days, and the crops remain edible for 30 days before perishing. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a heroes' feast. The benefits don\u2019t set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time. Once the shabti is used to perform either function, the shabti returns to statuette form, and it can\u2019t be used again until 30 days have passed. Healer Shabti (Very Rare). This shabti is dressed in scholarly robes and carries a bag of medical supplies. It is proficient with a healer\u2019s kit, has Medicine +7, and tends to the wounds of you and your companions. If directed to administer care when you take a short rest, the shabti can tend the wounds of up to six creatures over the course of the hour. Each creature that spends Hit Dice to regain hit points during that short rest increases the amount gained per Hit Die by 2, up to the maximum number that can be rolled. The shabti follows you and tends to the wounds of you and your companions, as directed, for up to 8 hours before reverting to statuette form. While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast cure wounds (4th-level version), lesser restoration, or protection from poison on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn\u2019t ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed. Warrior Shabti (Rare). This shabti wields a spear and carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. This shabti has the animated armor\u2019s Multiattack and Slam actions, except the shabti\u2019s Slam attack deals piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the animated armor\u2019s Slam attack. This shabti can understand and carry out fairly complex commands, such as standing watch while you and your companions rest or guarding a room and letting only specific creatures in or out.

The demon makes hasty apologies for its \u201ccurse\u201d, manipulating its wielder into serving its will\u2014it acts as a powerful weapon but slowly drains away their vital essences until they die, all the while using them to track down potential cures for its transformation.\n\n**Forgotten Fiend**\n\nLong ago Skrivena Moc was defeated by the great elven wizard Stariji. Rather than banish the demon and allow it to reform in the Abyss, the mage transformed the evil monster into something more useful: a sword to bestow upon her champions. It suffered for centuries as a tool of justice, made to forcefully cut down hundreds of fiends in the name of its most hated enemy. After nearly a millennium of belligerent service however, Stariji finally succumbed to her age and died peacefully in her bed. With the elven wizard and all her champions gone Skrivena Moc was left to molder deep within its cursed enemy\u2019s home amongst other treasures\u2014but as centuries passed it eventually was discovered and has escaped to wreak havoc on the world once more.\n\nSkrivena Moc constructs a web of lies, propping itself up as Stariji\u2019s most trusted warrior who chose to serve the elven mage against evil even after death. It promises everything an adventurer could want and more if only they\u2019ll wield it\u2014and the demon keeps its promises, in a way. The fiend blade is powerful even in untrained hands, though it is also full of deception. Whatever lies and half-truths the sword produces, it has only one goal in mind: Skrivena Moc wishes to return to its true demonic form. Stariji\u2019s old enchantment has weakened over the centuries and allowed for some of its fiendish essence to leach out, but it still cannot escape the mage\u2019s trap. As it seems the old wizard never shared her techniques, Skrivena Moc must find her spellbook, the only known source that contains the techniques to restore its form. Even death cannot save it, as the mage ensured that it cannot be destroyed only to reform in the Abyss while in this cursed shape.\n\n**Skrivena Moc, Whispering Blade Challenge 4+**\n\n_Small fiend_ 1,100 XP+\n\n**Armor Class** 19 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 180 (19d6+114)\n\n**Speed** 0 ft.\n\n**STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA**\n\n26 (+8)15 (+2)22 (+6)20 (+5)16 (+3)22 (+6)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver DC** 19\n\n**Saving Throws** Con +8, Wis +5, Cha +8\n\n**Skills** Arcana +9, Deception +10, History +9, Insight +7, Intimidation +10, Investigation +9, Perception +7, Persuasion +10\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** fire, poison\n\n**Condition Immunities** _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 17\n\n**Languages** Abyssal, Common, telepathy 120 ft.\n\n_**Death Throes.**_ When Skrivena Moc dies it explodes and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites unattended flammable objects in the area. Any creature currently attached to Skrivena Moc has _disadvantage_  on this save.\n\n_**Demonic Blade.**_ While Skrivena Moc is attached to a creature, the creature gains the attached template.\n\n_**Immobile.**_ Skrivena Moc has been magically forced into the form of a blade and is unable to move on its own.

Skrivena Moc has _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against spells and other magical effects.\n\n**_Prized Glamer._** Skrivena Moc has an illusion around it that makes it look and feel like a golden longsword. Creatures who physically interact with the figment can determine that the sword is glamored with a DC 22 Arcana or Investigation check. Skrivena Moc can use a bonus action to activate or dismiss this illusion.\n\n_**Variable Challenge Rating.**_ Skrivena Moc\u2019s CR is equal to its wielder\u2019s level or CR (minimum CR 4).\n\nACTIONS\n\n**_Corrupting Siphon (Recharge 5\u20136)_**. The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Constitution _saving throw_  or reduces its Charisma by 2 (1d4). Skrivena Moc regains 1d8 hit points for each point of Charisma lost in this way. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until Skrivena Moc is no longer attached to the creature, at which point it recovers 1 Charisma at the end of each _long rest_ .\n\n_**Demonic Leeching (3/Day)**_. Skrivena Moc uses its natural resistances to filter out its wielder\u2019s ailments, ending either the _poisoned_  condition or one nonmagical _disease_  afflicting the attached creature.\n\n_**Grip of Control.**_ The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Wisdom _saving throw_  or temporarily loses control to the fiend blade until the end of Skrivena Moc\u2019s next turn (as __dominate person_ ).\n\n_**Trusty Blade**_. The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Charisma _saving throw_  or it is _charmed_  for the next hour. If the attached creature\u2019s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. \n\nREACTIONS\n\n_**Fiendish Attachment.**_ When a creature grasps Skrivena Moc\u2019s hilt, it can use reaction to attach to the creature. Once attached, the creature cannot let go and is forced to wield Skrivena Moc with whatever limb it used to grab the hilt. Skrivena Moc can use an action to detach from a creature and otherwise detaches when it dies, the attached limb is severed, or if it is dealt 35 or more radiant damage in a single round.\n\n_**Justified Paranoia**_. Whenever Skrivena Moc hears its name mentioned or is otherwise suspicious of a creature, it can use its reaction to telepathically delve into the creature\u2019s mind (as _detect thoughts_ ; save DC 19)."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Skrivena Moc, Whispering Blade "", ""rarity"": ""Legendary"", ""requires_attunement"": """", ""slug"": ""skrivena-moc-whispering-blade-a5e"", ""type"": ""Weapon""}",,eda585a95a7ee03be81e6f1ebaa5f2fb3e4883425471d779d532cc8d0fe076d9,2025-11-24T04:46:04.768261Z

It\u2019s magical properties become apparent however when it moves, as it stands on hundreds of tiny humanoid legs and opens to reveal a long red tongue and a rim dotted with sharp teeth. It functions like a typical chest with the following additional properties.\n\n**_Mimic-Like._** _The Traveling Chest_ can use an action to appear to be a mundane chest, and you can verbally command it to do so. While mimicking a normal chest in this way it is indistinguishable from its mundane counterpart.\n\n_**Multiple Interiors.** The Traveling Chest_ has 1,000 different interior spaces, each 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall. You can verbally request any particular space (such as the last one, or the one with my laundry in it) and when opened the chest reveals that interior. Otherwise the chest opens to reveal a random interior space. While the chest is closed, all of its interior spaces are located within separate pocket dimensions. These pocket dimensions have no air, and any Supply stored within them instantly deteriorates and rots as if decades have passed as soon as the chest is closed. Only you can summon up the other interiors in this way, and any other creature that opens the chest only finds the \u201cfirst interior\u201d.\n\n_**Relentless.**_ Once you attune to _The Traveling Chest_, it relentlessly follows you until it sits no more than 15 feet away from you. The chest is magically aware of your location at all times, even if you are on a separate plane. If separated from you the chest travels towards you as fast as it can to the best of its ability and it attacks any creature that attempts to hinder its progress. If you are functionally unreachable, such as being on a different plane or across an ocean, the chest still progresses using even esoteric or hidden methods of reaching you such as magic portals or stowing away on ships headed in your direction.\n\n_**Imprinted.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ does not relinquish attunement once attuned, and you cannot voluntarily remove this attunement. If you attune to additional magic items beyond your limit, _The Traveling Chest_ always remains as one of your attuned items. \n\n_**Pack Lightly.** The Traveling Chest_ does not like being weighed down too much, and can carry a maximum of 10 bulky items. Any additional bulky items you attempt to store within it are spit out. \n\n_**Sentience.** The Traveling Chest_ is a sentient construct with Intelligence 3, Wisdom 14, and Charisma 12\\. It has blindsight to a range of 60 feet. _The Traveling Chest_ cannot speak or read, but it understands Common and Elvish. _The Traveling Ches_t lacks proper communication, but can animalistically communicate simple emotions (most often boredom or rage).\n\n_**Personality.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ has the intellect and temperament of a poorly trained dog. Loyalty has been branded magically into its psyche but its actual obedience is looser. The chest is playful and quick to anger, yet is utterly committed to following whomever is attuned to it. It also isn\u2019t a fighter and ignores outright commands to attack, though it defends itself in combat when it is attacked. It likes to be used for its intended purpose, happiest when numerous items are stored within it and regularly retrieved. If left idle or unused for more than a day it will come into conflict. While in conflict the chest intentionally opens to the wrong interior spaces, or remains indignantly locked, and it generally acts snippy and uncooperative. An apology and DC 14 Animal Handling or Persuasion check calms the chest down and ends the conflict, or if it feels genuinely mistreated, it can be offered a full wardrobe\u2019s worth of new clothing to store as a peace offering.\n\n---\n\n**The Traveling Chest Challenge 7**\n\n_Medium construct_ 2,900 XP\n\n**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 119 (14d6+70)\n\n**Speed** 50 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n18 (+4) 14 (+2) 20 (+5) 3 (\u20134) 14 (+2) 12 (+1)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver** DC 15\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** necrotic, poison, thunder\n\n**Condition Immunities** _fatigued_ , _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 12\n\n**Languages** understands but can not speak Common, Elvish\n\n**_False Appearance._** While _The Traveling Chest_ remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary chest.\n\n_**Immutable Form**_.

If the target is a creature, it is _grappled_  (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is _restrained_ , and the chest can't bite another target.\n\n_**Swallow.**_ The chest makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is _grappling_ . If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is _blinded_  and _restrained_ , it has _total cover_  against attacks and other effects outside the chest, and it begins _suffocating_  at the start of each of the chest\u2019s turns.

You gain a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this magic sword. Additionally, you can speak the blade\u2019s command word as a bonus action to cause it to shed _bright light_  in a 20-foot radius and _dim light_  for an additional 20 feet. Repeating the command word or sheathing the blade extinguishes the light. Objects hit with this sword take the maximum damage the weapon\u2019s damage dice can deal.\n\nTyrfing has 9 charges, which it does not regain while attuned to a creature. These charges are fully restored if a new creature attunes to it, but a previous bearer who attunes to the sword again only ever has the same pool of charges. When you use the sword to deal a critical hit against a creature that is not a construct or undead and has 100 or fewer hit points, it must make a DC 16 Constitution _saving throw_ . Each time a creature is killed in this manner the sword expends a charge.\n\n**_Curse._** Prior to 3 charges being expended from the blade, it will cause some tragedy or misfortune to befall you and will not expend its third charge until it has. The exact details and timing of this evil are up to the Narrator, but good examples include: causing you to automatically fail a crucial ability check (particularly one that would lead to further disaster, such as failing to identify an ally in the dark and accidentally attacking them); causing an ally who is reduced to 0 hit points to be incapable of rolling successes on death saving throws, leading to their death unless they are healed or stabilized by another creature; or causing all your next critical hits during a given combat to miss instead.\n\nMisfortune occurs again before 6 charges have been expended, and it will not expend the sixth until it has done so. Likewise, it must do so a third time before expending the final charge. If you break your attunement with Tyrfing with a pending misfortune, you remain _cursed_  until either the misfortune occurs or until you are targeted by a _remove curse_  spell cast using a 9th-level spell slot.\n\nOn expending the final charge, you must make a DC 16 constitution save. On a failure, you are slain by the sword just as surely as your opponent. On a success, you instead gain the _doomed_  condition, dying soon thereafter in a tragic manner unless powerful magic intervenes. Regardless of the result, Tyrfing then disappears. 1 week later it appears somewhere on your plane, searching for a new wielder to afflict.\n\n_Note:_ The exact mechanics of the following curse are for the Narrator and should be kept vague for players, even if they discover it is cursed. It is enough in that case for them to know Tyrfing will bring about three great evils and eventually the death of its wielder. The sword is nothing if not persistent, and attempts to leave it behind without breaking attunement merely mean that Tyrfing appears near its bearer 24 hours later.\n\n### Lore\n\nTyrfing was a sword forged under duress by the dwarves Svalinn and Durinn for Svafrlami, a king and grandson of Odin. Per his instructions, it shown with bright light, could cut through stone and steel as easily as flesh, and would never dull or rust. However, because their services were obtained under duress by threat of force, they also cursed the blade so that whenever drawn it would take a life, that it would bring about three great evils, and that it would eventually take Svafrlami\u2019s life. This all came to pass, and the sword continued to bring disaster and ruin to each new wielder, its cursed hunger for tragedy never sated."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Tyrfing, the Thrice-Cursed Sword of Tragedy"", ""rarity"": ""Legendary"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""tyrfing-the-thrice-cursed-sword-of-tragedy-a5e"", ""type"": ""Weapon""}",,57e2f3d65cd8d1fb810b202804165474e636dab6fce7667f46dc82cce2a36580,2025-11-24T04:46:05.944903Z

As enigmatic as the forces it commands, the origins of the Veil of Fate are unknown. It was brought to historical attention when it was revealed as the source of a renowned seer\u2019s remarkable abilities, her foretellings reached the ears of queens and generals, shaping a continent and undoubtedly the whole of history. Fearful of her influence and envious of the veil\u2019s power, those outside of her circle of influence conspired to behead her and take the relic. The subsequent fighting and intrigue saw the Veil of Fate become lost for centuries, occasionally appearing in tales as fantastic as they were inscrutable. While this tale is the best known, records of the Veil of Fate\u2019s existence can be traced to the beginnings of written history, its bearers painted as either titans of achievement or dire warnings to be heeded by the wise.\n\nThe Veil of Fate is a diaphanous silver and gray cloth attached to a thin silvery band which is worn on the bearer\u2019s head. When worn correctly, it falls to the floor around its bearer, covering them entirely in a faint silver shimmer. It is unknown whether or not this appearance is due purely to the physical nature of the veil or its powers taking the bearer slightly beyond the bounds of reality.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Veil of Fate_, which allows the wearer to see the very strands of destiny. \n\n**DC 18** The veil grants glimpses into the future.\n\n**DC 21** Many who have donned the veil are immediately struck by disturbingly accurate premonitions of the future.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Veil of Fate_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nWhen you are wearing and attuned to the veil, creatures have _disadvantage_  on _opportunity attacks_  against you as the combination of your enhanced foresight and diaphanous appearance bamboozles your foes.\n\nThe glimpses of the future granted by the _Veil of Fate_ are not always advantageous. You are always last in the initiative order as you are overwhelmed with insights into the events that are about to unfold, though you may choose to use your foretelling roll (see Control Fate below) for all of your initiative checks for the day.\n\nIn addition, you can impart some of the veil\u2019s power by falling into a deep meditation for 8 hours. When your meditation is concluded, your touch bestows one of the benefits of the _Veil of Fate_ onto an allied creature, and you suffer a level of _fatigue_  from the effort.\n\n**Foretelling**\n\nAt the Narrator\u2019s discretion, when you first attune to the Veil of Fate you are granted a detailed premonition of future events, presenting the opportunity to intertwine those threads of fate with your own. You can perfectly recall the premonition for a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 day), after which the memory is gone as if you never experienced it. Anything you write down or otherwise record about the premonition during this time is all that remains. Another creature may be given a different premonition or no premonition upon attuning to the veil. You can occasionally recall key details of the premonition at important crossroads in the future before the depicted events occur, and otherwise receive guidance from the premonition long after you\u2019ve forgotten it.\n\n**Choose Your Destiny**\n\nWhile attuned to the Veil of Fate you are keenly aware of your own destiny. \n\nWhen you spend 8 hours meditating on your destiny and life\u2019s purpose, you can see some of the steps you must take to change it. This meditation brings on a profound change, and when it is concluded you may choose a new _Destiny_ .\n\n**Control Fate**\n\nWhen you finish a long rest, you are bolstered by a strange sense of how to get the most out of your interactions and endeavours, gaining inspiration.\n\nIn addition, after completing a long rest you roll a d20\\. This is your foretelling roll. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, _attack roll_ , or _saving throw_ , you may choose to replace the d20 roll with your foretelling roll. You may choose to use this property after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the roll\u2019s effects occur. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.\n\n**Magic**\n\nYou may cast _augury_  at will while attuned to and wearing the _Veil of Fate_.\n\nTwice per _long rest_  you can cast one of the following spells without consuming material components or expending a spell slot: _arcane eye , clairvoyance , commune , divination_ .\n\nRoll a d20 after each _long rest_ . On an 18 or above, you gain the benefits of the __foresight_ spell."", ""document__slug"": ""a5e"", ""document__title"": ""Level Up Advanced 5e"", ""document__url"": ""https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"", ""name"": ""Veil of Fate"", ""rarity"": ""Artifact"", ""requires_attunement"": ""requires attunement"", ""slug"": ""veil-of-fate-a5e"", ""type"": ""Wondrous Item""}",,939eca10f7371eb298cbb27dbadda58056db3a8ab2ac3a7a6d68f586bc85d8f1,2025-11-24T04:46:05.944903Z

On a 1, the wand violently shakes and sparks with magic then disappears.\n\n__**Table: Wand of Wonder**__\n| **d100** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 01\u201305    | You cast _slow ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 06\u201310    | You cast __faerie fire ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 11\u201315    | You are awestruck and become _stunned_  until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 16\u201320    | You cast _gust of wind ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 21\u201325    | You cast __detect thoughts_  on the target.

It can gesture to indicate directions and communicate very basic single-word ideas to you telepathically. The stone has a number of charges, depending on the size of the creature stored within it. The stone has 6 charges if the creature is Large or smaller, 10 charges if the creature is Huge, and 12 charges if the creature is Gargantuan.
